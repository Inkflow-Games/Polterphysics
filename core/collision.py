collision.py

A script that provides functions for detecting and resolving collisions 
between objects using physics-based calculations.

Features include:
- Compute Euclidean distance and direction vector between two points.
- Resolve collisions between two circular objects.
- Update object velocities based on mass and direction of impact.
