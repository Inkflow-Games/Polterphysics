physics_engine.py

A simple physics engine that manages a collection of objects and handles collisions.

Features include:
- Adding and removing objects from the simulation
- Checking for collisions between objects (currently a placeholder)
- Resolving collisions (currently a placeholder)
- Updating object states and handling ground collisions
