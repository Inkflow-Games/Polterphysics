class Object:
    """
    A class representing a physical object with mass, velocity, position,
    and forces applied to it. This object will be affected by gravity and
    any external forces.

    Attributes:
        mass (float): The mass of the object.
        position (Vector2): The position of the object in 2D space.
        velocity (Vector2): The velocity of the object in 2D space.
        acceleration (Vector2): The acceleration of the object.
        damping_coefficient (Vector2): The rate at which the object's velocity decreases over time on each axis.
        max_speed (float): The maximum speed the object can reach.
        forces (list): A list of forces currently applied to the object.

    Methods:
        apply_force(force: Vector2): Applies a force to the object.
        update(dt: float): Updates the position and velocity of the object based on the forces applied.
